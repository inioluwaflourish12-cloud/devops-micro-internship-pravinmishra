# Assignment 3 — Deploy a React Application on Azure Virtual Machine Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision an Azure resource group, network, and Ubuntu 20.04 VM, then deploy the `my-react-app` React application onto the VM over SSH and serve it through Nginx.

---

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project

## Goal

Create a `terraform-react-azure` project directory for the Azure Terraform configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — File Explorer, VS Code, or terminal showing the `terraform-react-azure` project directory

---

# Task 2 — Write main.tf to Provision the Azure Infrastructure

## Goal

Define the resource group, virtual network/subnet, Network Security Group (SSH 22, HTTP 80), public IP, network interface, and Ubuntu 20.04 Standard B1s VM in `main.tf`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — VS Code showing `main.tf` with the required Azure resources, with any password or sensitive values hidden

---

# Task 3 — Initialize Terraform

## Goal

Run `terraform init` and confirm the working directory initializes successfully.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing successful `terraform init` output

---

# Task 4 — Plan and Apply the Configuration

## Goal

Review `terraform plan`, run `terraform apply`, and record the VM's public IP.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terraform apply output showing successful completion

---

# Task 5 — Connect to the Virtual Machine

## Goal

Establish an SSH session with the Ubuntu VM through its public IP.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing a successful SSH connection to the Azure VM

---

# Task 6 — Install Node.js, npm, and Git

## Goal

Update Ubuntu and install Node.js, npm, and Git.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing successful installation and the `node -v` and `npm -v` output

---

# Task 7 — Clone, Build, and Serve the React App with Nginx

## Goal

Follow the `my-react-app` repository README to clone, install, and build the app, then serve the production build through Nginx.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing the successful React build

![alt text](<screenshots/Screenshot 9 (Assignment 3 task7).png>)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal showing that Nginx is active and running

---

# Task 8 — Test the Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the React application loads through the VM's public IP and navigation works.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Browser showing the React application with the Azure VM public IP visible in the address bar

### Notes

Write a short summary of what you built and any issues you encountered and how you resolved them.

I built an Azure-based React application deployment using Terraform. The infrastructure included a resource group, virtual network, subnet, network security group, public IP, network interface, and Linux virtual machine. I also created a cloud-init script to automatically install Node.js and Nginx, clone and build the React application, and configure Nginx for deployment.

During deployment, the original `Standard_B1s` VM size was unavailable in South Africa North due to Azure capacity restrictions, so I used the available `Standard_B2ats_v2` size instead. I also encountered an SSH connection timeout, which was resolved by correcting the security rule to allow SSH access. After the changes, the VM was accessible through SSH, cloud-init completed successfully, Nginx was running, and the React application was verified in the browser.
