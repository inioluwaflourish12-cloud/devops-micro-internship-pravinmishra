# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Static HTML/CSS portfolio website deployed to AWS using S3 and CloudFront, provisioned with Terraform, and automated via GitHub Actions.

## Architecture

Pure HTML5 and CSS3. No JavaScript. No build step. No framework.

## Commands

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Conventions

- All infrastructure changes go through Terraform—never modify AWS resources manually.
- No JavaScript in this project.
- CSS uses a mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 600px, 768px, and 900px.

## Safety

- Never put secrets in this file. No API keys, passwords, or AWS credentials.
